# ConvertAI - Unit Conversion AI Chatbot

In this project, I developed a specialized unit conversion chatbot by fine-tuning Hugging Faceâ€™s SmolLM2 model. I designed and implemented a reusable pipeline for dataset resampling and model training, leveraging chain-of-thought prompting, supervised learning, and rejection sampling to enhance accuracy.

## Chat with the model!

You can chat with the model [here](https://github.com/ryanxshah/self-driving-car/tree/main/videos).

Try asking a question such as "What is 3.2km in miles?".
